getinfo                               Show generic implant information.
showrule [--all | rulenum]            Shows contents of enabled rules.
                                      All rules are shown if the --all flag is used.
getlog [--log logfile ] [entrynum]    Shows contents of the log.
                                      Starts at entry entrynum if provided or 0 otherwise.
                                      Optionally writes its output to logfile.
uninstall                             Uninstalls (unloads) sd module from router.
                                      Requires sd to be reinstalled after this command
                                      for future operations using sd.
Configuring min interval, max injections and inject window examples:
All times are input in seconds
	10 injections per 2 hour window until manually disabled and injections are 5 minutes apart.
		min interval = 300, max injections = 10, inject window = 7200
	10 injections then disable and injections are 5 minutes apart
		min interval = 300, max injections = 10, inject window = 0
	inject every 5 minutes until manually disabled
		min interval = 300, max injections = 0, inject window = 0
	The default is 5 injections the disable and injections are 60 seconds apart
